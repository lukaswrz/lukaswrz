Hello. This GitHub account is mostly for contributions to [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) projects, my actual activity is happening on [my Forgejo instance](https://hack.helveticanonstandard.net).
My actively maintained projects are [synchronized](https://hack.helveticanonstandard.net/helvetica/forgesync) to this account to increase visibility and allow GitHub users to create issues and pull requests on my repositories, but if you're reading this and primarily use GitHub, I encourage you to consider moving to an actually usable platform instead.

**Why might you want to do this?** This is the gist of it:

* GitHub is proprietary software.
* GitHub is a business, and their profit motive does not align with your goals as a free software developer. This is very transparent by taking a look at their copyright laundering of free software projects via Copilot.
* GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft.

A more detailed explanation can be found here: [Give Up GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)

**What are your options?**

* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is a very popular platform that uses [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) and is run by a [non-profit organization](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/what-is-codeberg/#what-is-codeberg-e.v.%3F). Not ideal, but still good enough if you're looking to expend the least amount of effort possible.
* You could host your own [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance, which is practically free if you already have a server for other purposes, and you can do whatever you want with it, including [actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/next/user/actions/overview/) and eventually [federation](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/federation/src/branch/main/FederationRoadmap.md).
* There are [countless](https://git.icyphox.sh/legit) [other](https://sourcehut.org/) [options](https://codemadness.org/stagit.html). In case the recommendations above don't fit your needs, I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
